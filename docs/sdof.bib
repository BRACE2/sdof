  abstract = {A nonlinear beam finite-element model is developed to account for distributed plasticity, complex degradation phenomena, axial–moment–shear interactions, and geometric nonlinearity. The formulation is derived based on consistently coupled degradation-plasticity multiaxial hysteretic laws. The strength degradations corresponding to axial, shear, and flexural capacities are treated as scalar damage functions, and the multiaxial hysteretic model is presented in the effective stress domain to satisfy the consistency criterion of the evolving yield/capacity surface. Geometric nonlinearity is incorporated through an element-level P-Δ formulation, by accounting for second-order transverse displacement effects in the beam kinematics. Constant element matrices, including elastic stiffness, geometric stiffness, and hysteretic matrices, are derived from the principle of virtual work and do not require updating throughout the analysis. Material inelasticity and degradations evolve through element-level ordinary differential equations (ODEs) based on the multiaxial hysteretic laws and are solved simultaneously with the governing equations of motion of the system. Overall, the entire system-level formulation is presented in state-space form and can be straightforwardly solved using any general first-order ODE solver without requiring gradient evaluations. Model consistency, validity, and versatility are demonstrated through several numerical illustrations and experimental verifications.

Response sensitivity and reliability analysis results are compared for a structural system modelled using smooth and non-smooth material constitutive laws, respectively. Both material and discrete loading sensitivity parameters are considered. Structural reliability analyses are performed using the First-Order Reliability Method. Implications of using smooth versus nonsmooth material constitutive models in finite element response, response sensitivity and reliability analyses are discussed. A sufficient condition on the smoothness of uni-axial material constitutive models for obtaining continuous finite element response sensitivities is stated and proved for the quasi-static case. The issue of continuity/discontinuity of response sensitivities for the dynamic case is discussed within the application examples.},

The numerical sensitivity of two damage evolution laws and two numerical integration schemes are investigated. The two damage models differ in that one of the models includes a threshold such that the damage evolution is suppressed until a certain effective plastic strain is reached. The classical integration scheme based on the implicit Euler scheme is found to suffer from a severe step-length dependence. An alternative integration scheme based on a diagonal implicit Runge--Kutta scheme originally proposed by Ellsiepen (1999) is investigated. The diagonal implicit Runge--Kutta scheme is applied to the balance of momentum as well as the constitutive evolution equations. When applied to finite strain multiplicative plasticity, the diagonal implicit Runge--Kutta scheme destroys the plastic incompressibility of the underlying continuum evolution laws. Here, the evolution laws are modified such that the incompressibility of the plastic deformation is preserved approximately. The presented numerical examples reveal that a significant increase in accuracy can be obtained at virtually no cost using the diagonal implicit Runge--Kutta scheme. It is also shown that for the model including a discontinuous evolution law, the superiority of the diagonal implicit Runge--Kutta scheme over the implicit Euler scheme is reduced.},

In the early 1980s, Filippou et al. improved the original model by introducing isotropic hardening and highlighted a flaw in the original formulation. Specifically, these researchers observed that if partial unloading takes place at strains lower than the maximum value the reloading path provides forces that are higher than those expected. Notwithstanding, Filippou et al. deemed that these errors were not particularly significant and did not propose any modification to the formulation of the model. In the opinion of the writers, this conclusion may be questionable and thus an improved version of the Menegotto and Pinto model is proposed here. In particular, the abovementioned flaw is eliminated and the improvement of this model over the original Menegotto and Pinto model is shown.},

Nevertheless, it is known that it exhibits displacement drift, force relaxation and nonclosure of hysteretic loops when subjected to short unloading–reloading paths. Consequently, it locally violates Drucker’s or Ilyushin’s postulate of plasticity. In this study, an effective modification of the model is proposed which eliminates these problems. A stiffening factor is introduced into the hysteretic differential equation which enables the distinction between virgin loading and reloading. Appropriate reversal points are utilized effectively to guide the entire process. It is shown that the proposed modification corrects the nonphysical behavior of the model under short unloading–reloading paths without affecting its response in all other cases. It is further demonstrated that the original and modified model exhibit significantly different response under seismic excitation.},

  abstract = {A simple mathematical model for the uniaxial cyclic stress-strain behavior of structural steel is proposed for arbitrary loading histories in the inelastic range. The model uses the monotonic and cyclic stress-strain curves as references and assumes the existence of stress bounds which cannot be exceeded in any given cycle. The movement of the bounds, which is controlled by hardening, softening, and mean stress relaxation, is determined by the strain amplitude of the last excursion and the previous stress-strain history. The rates of hardening, softening, and mean stress relaxation are determined from experimental data. The nonlinear portions of the stress-strain curves are defined by a continuously changing tangent modulus whose magnitude is a function of the distance between the stress bound and the instantaneous Stress. A comparison is made of predicted and experimentally obtained stress-strain histories. Although the model is developed specifically for types of histories associated with seismic excitations (small number of cycles), it should be applicable as well to low cycle fatigue problems involving large numbers of cycles since it is based on the stabilized cyclic stress-strain curve.},

The strength and stiffness deterioration is described by a continuous damage variable. The formulation uses a criterion based on the hysteretic energy and the maximum or minimum deformation for damage initiation with a cumulative probability distribution function for the damage evolution. A series of structural component response simulations showcase the ability of the model to describe different types of hysteretic behavior. The relation of the model's damage variable to the Park-Ang damage index is also discussed.

The behaviour of the constituent materials and the pier member as a whole were investigated. A literature review of the cyclic stress-strain behaviour of reinforcing steel at quasi-static and dynamic strain rates is given. A test program to test the behaviour of the grades of reinforcing steel produced in New Zealand was conducted an analytical stress-strain model is proposed. A critical literature review of proposed analytical models for unconfined and confined concrete is given as well as the effects of dynamic strain rates. Various conclusions and recommendations are reported. Methods for assessing the ductility capacity and ductility demand of piers are discussed. A review of some proposed methods for designing the confinement steel in the plastic-hinge region of a pier is given. A programme in which fourteen one-sixth scale model bridge piers were tested to destruction on a shake table was carried out. The effects of pier slenderness, the axial-load level, base motion, base fixity, and low-level shaking were investigated. The results of these tests were used to investigate the ability of analytical models which were developed from the observed behaviour of quasi-static test specimens to predict the behaviour and the response of piers subjected to base excitations. It was found that the general pier behaviour can be predicted satisfactorily although the pier strength and stiffness are increased by the dynamic strain rates. The general response can be predicted satisfactorily by inelastic time-history analyses but the peak response is poorly predicted by both inelastic time-history analyses and spectral analyses. The modes of failure of the piers are investigated and the effect of buckling causing the fracture of the longitudinal steel is discussed. The effect of axial-load level and pier slenderness on the length of the plastic hinge is discussed.}

  abstract = {The theoretical relations between the tension and compression stress-strain curves of ductile metals in the natural coordinate system are presented. In addition, a macroscopic model is formulated to predict the cyclic stress-strain behavior of reinforcing steel. The model is based on the natural coordinate system and represents the Bauschinger effect by a simple expression. It also considers the reduction of the unloading modulus with the plastic strain. Furthermore, the reduction of the ultimate tensile strain is taken solely as a function of the maximum compressive strain when the number of cycles is small enough to ignore the effects of low-cycle fatigue. Data collected from tests on New Zealand manufactured steel grades 300 and 430 were used in the calibration of the model. It is shown that the shape of the Bauschinger effect is dependent on the chemical composition of the steel. It is proposed that a generalization of the calibrated model for use in other reinforcing steel types may be possible by considering the carbon content as a variable.},

  abstract = {Study of collapse-resisting properties of structures has attracted widespread attention because of frequently occurring earthquakes and extreme events (e.g. blast) around the world. The developments in computational methods have enabled researchers to numerically simulate the collapse of structures under different kinds of loadings and provide reliable assessments of the collapse performance of structures. The dynamic nature of structural collapse requires a direct integration algorithm to solve the equations of motion of the numerical simulation model. A major concern in such simulations is the computational efficiency, which stems from the need to use a small time step size in both implicit algorithm and explicit algorithm. In this paper, modeling techniques to simulate typical failure mechanisms in reinforced concrete frame structures combined with the application of the recently developed explicit, unconditionally stable, parametrically dissipative KR-α integration method to investigate collapse simulation are presented. A fiber beam-column element is used to model the frame members, where the material nonlinearities, especially material softening, are simulated by a plastic damage model combined with a failure criterion. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the proposed collapse simulation technique. The results indicate that the proposed technique provides an accurate result and has exceptional computational efficiency. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {General features of the hysteretic behavior of wood joints and structural systems are characterized, and the available hysteresis models for wood systems are reviewed. A general hysteresis model for single- and multiple-degree-of-freedom wood joints and structural systems, based on a modification of the Bouc-WenBaber-Noori model, is presented and used in nonlinear dynamic analysis of single-degree-of-freedom wood systems. The hysteretic constitutive law produces a smoothly varying hysteresis that models previously observed behavior of wood joints and structural systems, such as nonlinearity, strength and stiffness degradation, and pinching. It takes into account the experimentally observed dependence of wood joints' response to the input and response at an earlier time (known as memory). Hysteresis shapes produced by the model are shown to compare favorably with experimental hysteresis of wood joints with (1) yielding plates; (2) yielding nails; and (3) yielding bolts.},

  abstract = {Numerical models of structural components that deteriorate primarily due to geometric instabilities under multiaxis cyclic loading are sensitive to both the assumed geometric imperfections and the nonlinear material model assumptions. Therefore, the accuracy of the constitutive model is a desirable feature in finite-element simulations. However, the classic Voce-Chaboche metal plasticity model, ubiquitous among commercial finite-element software, is found to underestimate the initial yield stress in structural steels by about 10\%–30\% when calibrated to minimize the overall difference in strain energy between the model and test data of load protocols representative of earthquake loading. This paper proposes a refined version of the Voce-Chaboche material model. When compared with the original model, the updated one improves the prediction of the initial yield stress, can simulate initial yield plateau behavior, and better estimates experimental cyclic stress-strain data. Constraints on the model parameters are established, a calibration procedure is developed, and model parameters are proposed for nine structural steels used worldwide. Source code for the material model is also made publicly available. A case study demonstrates that steel component behavior is sensitive to subtle differences in the material response that arise between the Voce-Chaboche and the proposed material models.

Accordingly, many hysteretic restoring force models were developed to include the time dependent nature using a set of differential equations.

Conceptually, the stress strain relation of concrete as a nonhomogenous and nonlinear composite material is not unique that depends on the many variables. In this study some common mathematical models for concrete in the stress-strain relation have been discussed to clarify mechanical behavior of concrete up to ultimate strain. However models of concrete confined by fiber composites corresponding to Stress -Strain relations of TDY2007 and ACI 2002 codes were compared for strengthening concrete sections. Furthermore it is noted that using FRP material increases both strength and ductility of compressive sections.},

  doi = {10.26021/2950},
  abstract = {This thesis is concerned with the inelastic behaviour of reinforced concrete members subjected to cyclic over­load. Theoretical methods for predicting the flexural behaviour of reinforced concrete members have been advanced and compared with experimental evidence at each stage in the development. Particular attention has been paid to the influence of conventional rectangular binding steel on the stress-strain properties of concrete and the effect on ductility in reinforced concrete beams and columns. The Bauschinger Effect in cyclically-stressed structural grade reinforcing steel was studied in some detail, both experimentally and theoretically, and a mathematical model for this behaviour was derived and is incorporated in the analyses. Since cyclic loading predictions require the complete loading histories of the component materials to be known, and since both materials have complex responses to this type of load, all of the analyses have been programmed for computer use. A further experimental programme using cyclically­loaded beams was conducted in order to compare theoretical and experimental moment-curvature and load-deflection behavior. These beams were simply-supported and cyclically-loaded to simulate seismic response in beams at connections with columns. Close agreement between experiment and the proposed theories was found.}

This is extended herein to incorporate two specific modifications; one accounting for the loading history effect in stiffness degradation, pointed out by Wang and Foliente [4], and another related to compatibility with plasticity postulates. The latter is independently enforced based on the method developed by Charalampakis and Koumousis [5], eliminating the model’s displacement drift, force relaxation and non-closure of hysteretic loops when subjected to short unloading–reloading paths.

From this condition, normality conditions in strain space (in this sense) and in the space of the second Piola-Kirehhoff stress (in the usual sense) are derived.

In the experimental program, a series of nine cantilever beams, representing half-scale models of the lower story girder of a 20-story ductile moment-resisting reinforced concrete office building, were designed according to present seismic codes. These beams were designed in order to study the effects of (1) the slab by testing T-beams with a top slab width equal to the effective width specified by the ACI 318-71 Code; (2) relative amounts of top and bottom reinforcement by varying the amounts of bottom reinforcement; (3) supplementary ties by providing hairpin ties around the main bars not restrained by the corners of stirrup ties; (4) the high shear force by varying the shear-span ratio; and (5) loading histories by testing some beams under loading reversals inducing a gradually increased deformation, and others under monotonic loadings to large deformations in one direction. The significance of the experimental results in relation to the seismic design of the reinforced concrete critical region is discussed. Analytical studies were carried out to gain a better understanding of the flexure, shear, and bond-resisting mechanisms in the reinforced concrete critical regions subjected to inelastic load reversals.}

The paper presents the development of the hysteretic model and the definitions of the control parameters, which can be determined using any suitable theoretical model for masonry infills. An available theoretical model for simplified engineering evaluation of masonry infilled frames was explored for estimating the control parameters of the proposed macromodel. The macromodel was incorporated in a nonlinear structural analysis program, IDARC2D Version 4.0, for quasi-static cyclic and dynamic analysis of masonry infilled frames. Simulations of experimental force-deformation behavior of prototype infill frame subassemblies are performed to validate the proposed model. A lightly reinforced concrete frame structure is analyzed for strong ground motions to evaluate the influence of masonry infill panels on the dynamic response.},

  abstract = {Abstract             In a standard design practice, it is often necessary to assemble engineered structures from individually manufactured parts. Ideally, the assembled system should perform as if the connections between the components were perfect, that is, as if the system were a single monolithic piece. However, the fasteners used in those connections, such as mechanical lap joints, are imperfect and highly nonlinear. In particular, these jointed connections dissipate energy, often through friction over highly localized microscale regions near connection points, and are known to exhibit history dependent, or hysteretic behavior. As a result, while mechanical joints are one of the most common elements in structural dynamics problems, their presence implies that assembled structural systems are difficult to model and analyze. Through rigorous experimental, analytical, and numerical work over the past century, researchers from several different disciplines have developed numerous damping models that give rise to the dynamical behavior attributed to joints. This work seeks to review, compare, and contrast several linear and nonlinear damping models that are known to be relevant to modeling assembled structural systems. These models are presented and categorized to place them in the proper historical and mathematical context as well as presenting numerous examples of their applications. General properties of hysteretic friction damping models are also studied and compared analytically. Connections are drawn between the different models so as to not only identify differences between models, but also highlight commonalities not normally seen to be in association.},

  abstract = {The effects of inelastic buckling on monotonic and cyclic behavior of reinforcing steel bars are studied. Experimental tests show that this phenomenon occurs when the ratio between length and diameter of the bar exceeds 5, and that it leads to a postyield softening branch in compression that strongly influences the cyclic behavior of the bar. An analytical model of rebars accounting for inelastic buckling is presented, suitable for inclusion in programs for the analysis of rlc sections using the fiber type of discretization. The model employs four hardening rules (kinematic, isotropic, memory, and saturation) as functions of four independent parameters (yield stress, elastic modulus, hardening ratio, and a weighing coefficient). An explicit stress-strain relation in finite terms for loading branches is utilized. The model yields accurate results in predicting the cyclic behavior of rebars, both with and without inelastic buckling, for deformation paths of general nature.},

In many problems of plastic deformation, when the prescribed loads or displacements do not increase ill proportion but vary in a complex manner, for instance alternating between prescribed limits, more general workhardening models are needed in order to describe the plastic behavior. One of such models, previously proposed by the author, is applied here in order to discuss superposition of fixed and alternating loads. In particular, the ease of steady tension and Mternating torsion is considered in detail and the rate of axiM strain accumulation is computed. There is a quMitative aggreement between theoretical prediction and experimental data.},

For this reason, many researchers have proposed several variants of the original Bouc-Wen model.

  abstract = {This paper presents a smooth hysteresis model for reinforced concrete (RC) structural elements based on the differential equation of the Bouc–Wen model. Stiffness degradation and strength degradation are defined by introducing a damage index that includes both dissipated energy and maximum displacement. The pinching effect acts directly on the stiffness of the system and is controlled by an activation energy. The degrading functions are connected to the actual processes with which the damage occurs, thereby giving each parameter a physical meaning. The simple formulation of the model allows a straightforward identification of the best-fitting parameters and an easy interpretation of the results. Applications to the cyclic behaviour of RC structural elements demonstrate that the model is well capable of describing complex hysteretic behaviours involving degradation and pinching effects.},

Their behavior has a significant influence on the seismic response of precast concrete frames in which the connections depend on these grouted bars. The critical response quantity is the displacement at the loaded end of the bar caused by inelastic strain penetration into the bonded region. A study was conducted using experimental and analytical methods. In the experimental part of the study, tests were conducted on bars that were grouted over only a short length to develop a constitutive relationship between local bond stress and slip. That relationship was then incorporated into an inelastic, finite element model of the bar. The model was validated by comparing the measured free end displacement of a fully developed bar with the value predicted by analysis. It was then used to conduct a parametric study that extended the investigation beyond the bounds of the matrix of the physical tests. The results of the parametric study were used to develop a simple design equation for predicting the displacement of the loaded end of the bar.},

  abstract = {Partial Differential Equations (PDE) are fundamental to model different phenomena in science and engineering mathematically. Solving them is a crucial step towards a precise knowledge of the behaviour of natural and engineered systems. In general, in order to solve PDEs that represent real systems to an acceptable degree, analytical methods are usually not enough. One has to resort to discretization methods. For engineering problems, probably the best known option is the finite element method (FEM). However, powerful alternatives such as mesh-free methods and Isogeometric Analysis (IGA) are also available. The fundamental idea is to approximate the solution of the PDE by means of functions specifically built to have some desirable properties. In this contribution, we explore Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) as an option for approximation. They have shown impressive results in areas such as visual recognition. DNNs are regarded here as function approximation machines. There is great flexibility to define their structure and important advances in the architecture and the efficiency of the algorithms to implement them make DNNs a very interesting alternative to approximate the solution of a PDE. We concentrate in applications that have an interest for Computational Mechanics. Most contributions that have decided to explore this possibility have adopted a collocation strategy. In this contribution, we concentrate in mechanical problems and analyze the energetic format of the PDE. The energy of a mechanical system seems to be the natural loss function for a machine learning method to approach a mechanical problem. As proofs of concept, we deal with several problems and explore the capabilities of the method for applications in engineering.},

Twenty-five concrete units, each 450 mm (17.7 in.) square by 1200 mm (47.2 in.) high, containing either 8 or 12 longitudinal steel bars and different arrangements of square or octagonal steel hoops, were subjected to concentric or eccentric loads to failure at different strain rates. Results presented include an assessment of the effect of eccentricity of load, strain rate, amount and distribution of longitudinal steel, and amont and distribution of transverse steel. A stress-strain curve for concrete confined by hoop reinforcement and loaded at a high strain rate (comparable with seismic loading) is proposed and compared with an wisting curve based on previous tests conducted at low strain rates. The available ultimate compressive strain for concrete confined by hoop reinforcement is also discussed.},

This paper presents the development of a versatile smooth hysteretic model based on internal variables, with stiffness and strength deterioration and with pinching characteristics. The theoretical background, development, and implementation of the model are discussed. Examples are shown to illustrate the features of the model. Many inelastic constitutive models in popular use have been developed independently of each other based on different behavioral, physical, or mathematical motivations. This paper attempts to unify the concepts underlying such models. Such a holistic understanding is essential to realize limitations in application of inelastic models and to extend 1D models to 3D models featuring interaction between various stress resultants.},

  abstract = {This work presents the development of a hysteretic beam element in the context of the finite element method, that is suitable for the inelastic dynamic analysis of framed structures. The formulation proposed is able to capture the main characteristics of hysteresis in structural systems and mainly accounts for stiffness degradation, strength deterioration and pinching phenomena, as well as for non-symmetrical yielding that often characterizes their behavior. The proposed formulation is based on the decoupling of deformations into elastic and hysteretic parts by considering additional hysteretic degrees of freedom, i.e., the hysteretic curvatures and hysteretic axial deformations. The direct stiffness method is employed to establish global matrices and determine the mass and viscous damping, as well as the elastic stiffness and the hysteretic matrix of the structure that corresponds to the newly added hysteretic degrees of freedom. All the governing equations of the structure, namely the linear global equations of motion and the nonlinear evolution equations at elemental level that account for degradations and pinching, are solved simultaneously. This is accomplished by converting the system of equations into state space form and implementing a variable-order solver based on numerical differentiation formulas (NDFs) to determine the solution. Furthermore, hysteretic loops and degradation phenomena are easily controlled by modifying the model parameters at the element level enabling simulations of a more realistic response. Numerical results are presented and compared against experimental results and other finite element codes to validate the proposed formulation and verify its ability to simulate complex hysteretic behavior exhibiting cyclic degradations.},

Theoretical formulations are derived from the second law of thermodynamics, in conjunction with a few plausible assumptions on energy transformation and dissipation. The role of plastic free energy is emphasized by a conceptual experiment showing its physical nature. Theoretical formulation is adapted in order to be applied in elastic–plastic finite element method (FEM) simulations. Developed methodology is verified through comparison of input work, stored energy, and energy dissipation of the system. Separation of plastic work into plastic free energy and energy dissipation removes a common mistake, made in a number of publications, where energy dissipation can attain negative values (energy production) which is impossible.},

  abstract = {Structures under dynamic loading usually exhibit nonlinear hysteretic behavior, especially under strong earthquake excitation. The exact nature of this behavior may vary greatly from structure to structure. Therefore, a lot of onedimensional hysteretic models have been developed, including the smooth-varying and piecewise-linear (PWL) varieties. In this paper, we present a synthesis and extension of the myriad hysteretic structural models into a general nonlinear hysteretic model, which is mathematically tractable and covers smooth-varying hysteretic models and various PWL hysteretic models. Because the formulation developed to describe the equation of motion is a nonlinear state equation, we can find the dynamic response explicitly, based on the explicit-integration approach, and dependably in both deterministic and stochastic ways. Based on the formulation, we also demonstrate the similarity of the responses of the PWL and smoothvarying hysteretic models. Finally, we add some comments on the extension of stochastic equivalent linearization techniques by smoothing the PWL hysteric models.},

Then this paper proposed a modified Monti-Nuti Model for different types of reinforcing bars, such as carbon steel reinforcement and stainless steel reinforcement including inelastic buckling. Subsequently, the implementation of the modified Mont-Nuti Model in OpenSees was introduced.
